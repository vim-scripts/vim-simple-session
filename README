Simple session is a straightforward, no hassle plugin for handling named
sessions in VIM.

Just type away :Session {name} for creating new sessions or switching to
old sessions. :SList, :SDelete and :SQuit pretty much do what they
promise. Commands that take an argument support autocompletion.

Sessions are automatically saved when VIM is closed or an old session is
opened up.
